## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/kiruthikpurpose/Copiare/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/kiruthikpurpose/Copiare/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with your suggestion, providing as much detail as possible.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Copiare users.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript Styleguide

- Use semicolons `;`
- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- Use `const` for all of your references; avoid using `var`
- If you must reassign references, use `let` instead of `var`

### CSS Styleguide

- Use classes for selectors when possible
- Avoid using IDs for styling
- Use kebab-case for class names
